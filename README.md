#Text Editor PWA
##Description
This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) focused on providing a robust and feature-rich text editor experience directly within the browser. The motivation behind building this project was to demonstrate proficiency in creating PWAs, utilizing IndexedDB for data persistence, and implementing offline functionality.

The text editor serves as a single-page application meeting PWA criteria, ensuring a seamless user experience. By employing IndexedDB, the application achieves data persistence, allowing users to access their documents even when offline. The project showcases the application of advanced web development concepts learned throughout the course.
