# Text Editor PWA
## Description
This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) focused on providing a robust and feature-rich text editor experience directly within the browser.

The text editor serves as a single-page application meeting PWA criteria, ensuring a seamless user experience. By employing IndexedDB, the application achieves data persistence, allowing users to access their documents even when offline. The project showcases the application of advanced web development concepts learned throughout the course.
